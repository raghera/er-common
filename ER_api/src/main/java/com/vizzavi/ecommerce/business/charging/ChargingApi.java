/**
 * Provides access to the charging subsystem for usage authorization requests.
 * The authorize methods return a UsageAuthorization object which must be queried
 * to see if authorization was successful. An exception is thrown
 * if the client passes in an unrecognised service identifier.
 * Service identifiers are well known names which uniquely identify a service for
 * a given locale.
 * <p>
 * In the case that the user is authorized for a service, the return object from the
 * authorize method can be queried for additional usage and charging information.
 * <p>
 * Example usage: <p>
<code>
<pre>

    ChargingApi chargingApi = EcomApiFactory.getChargingApi( locale );
    UsageAuthorization authResult =
        chargingApi.usageAuthRateCharge( "myApp", "447930666555", "vx_sports_news" );

    if( authResult.isAuthorized() ) {
        // deliver service
        ...
    }

</pre>
</code>

Handling errors can be done in a variety of ways depending on the application environment.

<code>
<pre>

    if( !authResult.isAuthorized() ) {

        switch( authResult.getReasonCode() ) {
             case ReasonCode.SUBSCRIPTION_EXPIRED:  ...

    }

</pre>
</code>


 * For platforms using two stage reserve/capture, the usageAuthRateCharge method can be called as normal
 * first. There <em>must</em> subsequently be a call to usageComplete.
 *

<code>
<pre>

    String eventReservationId = null;

    UsageAuthorization authResult =
        chargingApi.usageAuthRateCharge( "deliveryApp", "447930666555", "quake_III_J2ME" );

    if( authResult.isAuthorized() ) {

        // the id from usage auth result must be stored for later use in the complete call
        eventReservationId = authResult.getEventReservationId();

        // deliver game
        ...

    }


    // later on we have a delivery confirmation if the authorization result is reserved

    if (authResult.isReservedOnly()) {

        UsageAuthorization completionResult = chargingApi.usageComplete(
            "receiptApp",
            eventReservationId,
            ChargingApi.USAGE_COMPLETION_SUCCESS );

        if( completionResult.isAuthorized() == false ) {
            // some technical problem occurred!
        }

    }

</pre>
